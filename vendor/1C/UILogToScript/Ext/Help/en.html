<h1>Conversion of a user's activity log in built-in language</h1>
<p>Dataprocessor is designed to convert the log of user actions in program at embedded language.</p>
<p>Processing allows you to convert specified files or directly entered text. Select the appropriate option in the switch <strong>"Convert"</strong>.</p>
<p>Format program can be done in english or russian version embedded language. Default  language used from configuration. If necessary, generate the program in a different version, specify the required field "<strong>1C:Enterprise script language</strong>".</p>
<p>In the field "<strong>Main procedure name</strong>" specifies the name of procedure, that will be entry point to script.</p>
<p>If you plan to use generated procedure itself (e.g. in an external dataprocessor), it is possible to generate connection code to test client, by mark flag "<strong>To generate pairing code to client</strong>". Otherwise, for procedure will be created parameter<strong>TestingApplication</strong>, in which when you call will need to pass an existing object type TestApplication, which has already established connection with test client.</p>
<p>For readability of the resulting code generated by the program breaks at application "borders" windows to subroutines. If check box "<strong>Split scenario into procedures by application windows</strong>" there will be formed one large procedure.</p>
<p>Mark box "<strong>Get full object hierarchy</strong>" allows invocation of any object to generate obtaining all of parent test objects that are between current test object and form. If the check box is cleared - generated search for objects directly through object under test forms.</p></body></html>
